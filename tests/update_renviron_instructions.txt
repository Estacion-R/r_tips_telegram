INSTRUCTIONS TO UPDATE .Renviron FILE:

1. Open the .Renviron file in your text editor
2. Find this line:
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here

3. Replace it with your real OpenAI API key:
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-long-api-key-here

4. EXAMPLE of what a real key looks like:
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456

5. Save the file

6. Restart your R session completely

7. Test with: source("test_openai_key.R")

IMPORTANT:
- The key should be 50+ characters long

- No quotes around the key
- No spaces before or after the key
- You must restart R after updating
